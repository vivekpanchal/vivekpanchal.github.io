>I concur with the opinion that a person should establish his/her identity in the virtual world aka the world of Internet. Consequence being, this Blog.

I will be writing about propositions, issues and my daily activities as I atone on my way. This will contain more of a geeky stuff, hacks, programs, code etc. I hope this to be a lively and blissful experience.
