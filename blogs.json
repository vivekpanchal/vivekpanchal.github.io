Tip: Don\u2019t include the # character in the intent names when you create them in the Watson Assistant (formerly Conversation) tool.</p>\n<p>5. In the User example field, type the text of a user example for the intent. An example can be any string up to 1024 characters in length. The following might be examples for the #pay_bill intent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I need to pay my\u00a0bill.</li>\n<li>Pay my account\u00a0balance</li>\n<li>make a\u00a0payment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>6. Important: Intent names and example text can be exposed in URLs when an application interacts with the service. Do not include sensitive or personal information in these artifacts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Press Enter or click + to save the\u00a0example.</li>\n<li>Repeat the same process to add more examples. Provide at least 5 examples for each intent. The more examples you provide, the more accurate your application can\u00a0be.</li>\n</ol>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/939/1*lJeBcHhT1hlKENZBIZNeqg.png\"></figure><p>3.When you have finished adding examples, click Create to finish creating the\u00a0intent.</p>\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>The intent you created is added to the Intents tab, and the system begins to train itself on the new\u00a0data.</p>\n<p>You can click any intent in the list to open it for editing.

If the wrong intent is recognized, you can improve your model by adding this text as an example to the correct intent.Tip: If you have recently made changes in your workspace, you might see a message indicating that the system is still retraining. If you see this message, wait until training completes before\u00a0testing:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/349/0*TWImE6w-L8RkRgPC.png\"></figure><p>The response indicates which intent was recognized from your\u00a0input.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/353/0*4eMWW_iPX7zpjAJ7.png\"></figure><p>If the system did not recognize the correct intent, you can correct it.

The number of entities, entity values, and synonyms you can create in a single service instance depends on your Watson Assistant (formerly Conversation) service\u00a0plan:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the Watson Assistant (formerly Conversation) tool, open your workspace and then click the Entities\u00a0tab.</li>\n<li>Click Create\u00a0new.</li>\n<li>In the Add the entity name field, type a descriptive name for the entity.The entity name can contain letters (in Unicode), numbers, underscores, and hyphens. For\u00a0example:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>@location</li>\n<li>@menu_item</li>\n<li>@product</li>\n</ul>\n<ol><li>Tips:</li></ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t include the @ character in the entity names when you create them in the Watson Assistant (formerly Conversation) tool.</li>\n<li>Entity names can\u2019t contain spaces or be longer than 64 characters. And entity names can\u2019t begin with the string sys-, which is reserved for system entities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the Value field, type the text of a possible value for the intent. An entity value can be any string up to 64 characters in length.Important: Don\u2019t include sensitive or personal information in entity names or values. The names and values can be exposed in URLs in an\u00a0app.</p>\n<p>In the Synonyms field, type any synonyms for the entity value. A synonym can be any string up to 64 characters in length. Press Enter to save each\u00a0synonym.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/805/0*Brw6lVi-VJBQ3pjG.png\"></figure><ol>\n<li>Click + and repeat the process to add more entity\u00a0values.</li>\n<li>When you are finished adding values and synonyms, click\u00a0Create.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Building a\u00a0Dialog</h3>\n<p>The dialog component of the Watson Assistant (formerly Conversation) service uses the intents and entities that are identified in the user\u2019s input to gather required information and provide a useful response. Your dialog is represented graphically as a tree; create a branch to process each intent that you\u00a0define.</p>\n<p>Post branching Intents and entities, this is how my Watson Assistant (formerly Conversation) Dialog on IBM Cloud looks\u00a0like</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zoEsUHzqkxUrIZCOamVqyQ.png\"></figure><h4>now you can test your bot at the try out feature and integrate it on web app or and Android/iOS application.</h4>\n<p>you can check refer this link to how it works and go through that to build your own chatbot go<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hajhYPjyLGc&amp;t=466s\">\u00a0<strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Happy coding.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4420f647dff8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/code-yoga/building-a-chatbot-using-ibm-watson-conversation-service-4420f647dff8\">Building a chatBot using IBM watson conversation service</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/code-yoga\">Code Yoga</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["watson-conversation","bots"]}]}
